# State Untapped Potential Research Framework

A systematic approach to analyzing each state's blocked capacity and path to unlock it.
Based on the Minnesota deep-dive methodology.

## PHASE 1: BASELINE METRICS (Already Have)

| Metric | Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| State GDP | BEA | Annual, ~$XB |
| State Debt | Census/Moody's | Bond ratings matter |
| Capital Investment | Census of Governments | State + local capital outlays |
| Population | Census | For per-capita calculations |
| Energy Production | EIA | By source (nuclear, gas, wind, etc.) |

**Status:** ✅ Complete for all 50 states (estimates)

---

## PHASE 2: BLOCKED PROJECT INVENTORY

### 2.1 Identify Specific Blocked Projects

For each state, research and document:

| Field | Example (Minnesota) | How to Find |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Project Name** | Twin Metals copper-nickel | News archives, company filings |
| **Category** | Mining | - |
| **Investment Value** | $1.7B initial, $10B+ lifetime | Company announcements, EIS documents |
| **Jobs (direct)** | 750 construction, 350 permanent | Company estimates, EIS |
| **Jobs (indirect)** | 1,500+ supply chain | Economic impact studies |
| **Years Blocked** | 20+ years | Permit timeline tracking |
| **Current Status** | Leases cancelled 2022, litigation ongoing | Court filings, news |
| **Blocking Entity** | Federal (Biden admin lease cancellation) | Identify the actual blocker |
| **Stated Reason** | Environmental concerns (BWCA watershed) | Official statements |
| **Counter-evidence** | Similar mining in Canada, modern tech, no spills | Industry data, peer comparisons |

### 2.2 Project Categories to Investigate

- **Mining** — Permits blocked, leases cancelled, litigation
- **Nuclear** — Plant closures, new plant applications denied, SMR proposals
- **Pipelines** — Interstate permits, state-level blocks
- **Manufacturing** — Companies that left or chose elsewhere, citing regulations
- **Housing** — Units blocked by zoning, CEQA, environmental review
- **Water** — Desalination, reservoir projects, water rights
- **Transportation** — Highway expansions, rail, port upgrades
- **Energy Generation** — Any source blocked or delayed

### 2.3 Research Sources

| Source | What It Provides |
|--------|------------------|
| **State regulatory agencies** | Permit applications, denials, timelines |
| **Federal EIS database** | Environmental impact statements, public comments |
| **Court records (PACER)** | Litigation on blocked projects |
| **Company investor filings** | SEC 10-K mentions of regulatory risk by state |
| **Trade associations** | Mining, nuclear, manufacturing lobby reports |
| **Local newspapers** | Project-specific coverage |
| **State legislature records** | Bills to block/enable projects |
| **Think tanks** | Reason, Manhattan Institute, state-specific orgs |

---

## PHASE 3: POLITICAL ACTOR MAPPING

### 3.1 Who Blocks?

| Actor Type | Example (Minnesota) | Research Approach |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Governor** | Tim Walz (D) | Voting record, executive orders, public statements |
| **State Legislature** | DFL-controlled | Bill tracking, key committee chairs |
| **Attorney General** | Keith Ellison | Litigation record, enforcement actions |
| **Federal Delegation** | Klobuchar, Smith, McCollum, etc. | Votes on permits, public statements |
| **State Agencies** | DNR, PCA | Permit decisions, rulemaking |
| **Local Officials** | County commissioners, mayors | Zoning, local permits |
| **Activist Groups** | Sierra Club, specific local groups | Litigation filed, campaigns run |
| **Tribal Governments** | Specific bands with treaty rights | Treaty claims, litigation, partnerships |

### 3.2 Who Enables?

| Actor Type | Example (Minnesota) | Research Approach |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Pro-development politicians** | Lisa Demuth (R-Minority Leader) | Platform, statements, legislation introduced |
| **Business coalitions** | Iron Mining Association, Chamber | Lobbying, advocacy campaigns |
| **Labor unions** | Building trades, miners unions | Public positions (often split from enviro allies) |
| **Companies** | Cleveland-Cliffs, Twin Metals, PolyMet | Investment commitments, legal battles |
| **Federal allies** | Which agencies/officials are sympathetic? | Admin changes, policy shifts |

### 3.3 Power Balance Assessment

| Factor | Questions to Answer |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Governor control** | Who's in office? When's next election? Vulnerability? |
| **Legislature** | Which party controls? Margin? Key swing districts? |
| **Federal leverage** | Can federal action override state blocks? (permits, preemption) |
| **Court landscape** | State vs federal courts, recent rulings, judge appointments |
| **Public opinion** | Polling on development, jobs vs environment framing |

---

## PHASE 4: UNLOCK SCENARIOS

### 4.1 Political Path

| Scenario | Timeline | Probability | Trigger |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Governor change** | Next election cycle | Estimate % | Opponent strength, incumbent vulnerability |
| **Legislature flip** | Next election | Estimate % | Redistricting, national wave |
| **Federal action** | Current or next admin | Estimate % | Executive orders, agency rule changes |
| **Court victory** | Litigation timeline | Estimate % | Pending cases, appeals |
| **Ballot initiative** | If available | Estimate % | Signature requirements, polling |

### 4.2 Technical/Economic Path

| Scenario | Requirements | Feasibility |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **New technology** | Does new tech address stated concerns? | Which innovations change the calculus? |
| **Economic pressure** | State budget crisis, job losses | At what point does blocking become untenable? |
| **National security** | Federal override for critical minerals, defense | Which projects qualify? |
| **Private-public partnership** | Can companies partner with state/universities to build trust? | Minnesota lab model |

### 4.3 Example: Minnesota Path to Unlock

```
2025: Attack Walz (fraud exposure, job blocking narrative)
      ↓
2026: Demuth wins governorship (40-45% probability)
      ↓
2027: National Lab established (using existing facilities)
      6-9 month accelerated research + deregulation
      ↓
2028: Mining permits approved with lab oversight
      ↓
2028-30: $10B+ investment unlocked, 25,000+ jobs
```

## PHASE 5: QUANTIFY UNTAPPED POTENTIAL

### 5.1 Economic Impact Calculation

| Metric | How to Calculate |
|--------|------------------|
| **Direct Investment Blocked** | Sum of all blocked project investments |
| **Jobs Blocked** | Sum of direct + indirect jobs from EIS/company estimates |
| **Tax Revenue Lost** | State/local tax estimates from economic impact studies |
| **GDP Impact** | Multiplier effects (typically 1.5-2.5x direct investment) |
| **Energy Capacity Blocked** | GW of generation not built |
| **Critical Resource Blocked** | Tons of minerals, barrels of oil, etc. not produced |

### 5.2 National Security Impact

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Defense relevance** | Does blocked project affect military supply chain? |
| **Import dependence** | What % currently imported that this would offset? |
| **Ally vs adversary source** | Is current source China/Russia or Canada/Australia? |
| **Strategic stockpile** | Is this a stockpiled material? |

### 5.3 Comparative Ranking

Once multiple states are analyzed, rank by:

1. **Absolute $ blocked** — Total investment sitting on sidelines
2. **Jobs per $ blocked** — Labor intensity of blocked projects
3. **National security relevance** — Defense/critical mineral priority
4. **Unlock probability** — How likely is political/legal path?
5. **Timeline to unlock** — How fast could it happen?
6. **Unlock ROI** — $ unlocked per $ of political/advocacy investment

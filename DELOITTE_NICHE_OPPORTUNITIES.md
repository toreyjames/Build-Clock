# Deloitte Niche Opportunities in the Build Economy
## Where We're Not Playing — And Why We Should

---

## Executive Summary

The Build Clock reveals **$800B+ in industrial investment** creating thousands of new OT environments. Deloitte has strong capabilities in strategy, ERP, supply chain, and workforce — but there are **specific niches** where we're either not playing or not differentiated.

This analysis identifies **5 niche opportunities** where Deloitte can establish unique positioning:
1. **OT Asset Canonization** (Assurance Twin is unique)
2. **Commissioning-to-Operate OT Security** (greenfield security-by-design)
3. **Industrial AI Security** (securing AI in OT, not just AI strategy)
4. **EPC/Vendor OT Security Governance** (construction-phase security)
5. **Build Cycle Intelligence** (policy → pipeline → services connection)

Each niche addresses a specific gap in the build economy that competitors aren't solving.

## Niche Opportunity 1: OT Asset Canonization

### The Gap

**Problem:** Organizations building new plants have fragmented asset data:
- Engineering has P&IDs, asset registers, CMMS exports
- OT security tools (Claroty, Nozomi, Armis) have network discovery data
- Compliance teams have manual inventories
- **No single source of truth**

**Result:** Organizations can't answer basic questions:
- "What OT assets do we actually have?"
- "What's in engineering but not on the network?" (blind spots)
- "What's on the network but not in engineering?" (shadow OT)
- "What's the attack surface?"

### The Opportunity

**Assurance Twin** solves this — but it's not productized or marketed as a differentiated offering.

**What we have:**
- Asset canonization engine that merges multiple data sources
- Cross-verification logic (networkable vs. passive classification)
- Blind spot and orphan detection
- Industry-specific templates (Oil & Gas, etc.)

**What we're missing:**
- Productized offering with clear go-to-market
- Integration with OT Risk Score
- Marketing/eminence around this capability
- Pricing model and delivery methodology

### The Play

**"OT Asset Visibility as a Service"**
- Deploy Assurance Twin at commissioning (Day 1 baseline)
- Annual refresh to track asset drift
- Feed into OT Risk Score for insurance/risk management
- Differentiator: Only provider with canonization capability

**Target clients:**
- New builds in Build Clock pipeline (semiconductors, batteries, nuclear, grid)
- Legacy facilities doing OT security assessments
- Organizations preparing for insurance underwriting

**Competitive advantage:** No one else has this. OT security vendors (Claroty, Dragos, Nozomi) do discovery, but they don't canonize with engineering baseline.

---

## Niche Opportunity 2: Commissioning-to-Operate OT Security

### The Gap

**Problem:** OT security is typically bolted on **after** construction, when:
- Architecture is locked
- Vendors have left
- Systems are in production
- Remediation is expensive and disruptive

**Result:** New plants go live with security gaps that are hard to fix later.

### The Opportunity

**"Greenfield OT Security-by-Design"**

Get into projects at the **design/construction phase**, not post-commissioning.

**What this includes:**
- OT security architecture integrated into design (network segmentation, zone boundaries)
- Vendor security requirements (EPCs, integrators, equipment suppliers)
- Commissioning security validation (before go-live)
- Day 1 operational security (monitoring, access controls, IR readiness)

**The Build Clock connection:**
- $800B+ in new plants entering design/construction
- Each one needs OT security — but most aren't thinking about it until too late
- First-mover advantage: Get in at design phase, own the relationship

### The Play

**"Commissioning-to-Operate OT Security Package"**
1. **Design phase:** OT security architecture, vendor requirements
2. **Construction phase:** EPC oversight, vendor access controls
3. **Commissioning phase:** Security validation, asset inventory baseline
4. **Operate phase:** Ongoing monitoring, IR, annual refresh

**Target clients:**
- Semiconductor fabs (Intel, TSMC, Micron, Samsung)
- Battery plants (Ford/SK, Toyota, LG, etc.)
- Nuclear facilities (TMI restart, SMR deployments)
- Grid infrastructure (transmission, substations)

**Competitive advantage:** Most OT security vendors focus on **existing facilities**. We focus on **new builds** — where we can design security in from the start.

## Niche Opportunity 3: Industrial AI Security

### The Gap

**Problem:** Deloitte has strong AI strategy capabilities, but **securing AI in OT environments** is a different discipline.

**The distinction:**
- **AI Strategy:** "How do we use AI to optimize operations?"
- **AI Security:** "How do we secure AI systems in industrial environments?"

**AI in OT creates new attack vectors:**
- Model poisoning (corrupt training data → unsafe decisions)
- Adversarial inputs (fool AI vision systems)
- Data exfiltration (steal process IP, algorithms)
- AI-powered attacks (automated protocol fuzzing)

### The Opportunity

**"Industrial AI Security"** — specialized capability for securing AI/ML systems in OT environments.

**What this includes:**
- AI model security assessment (training data integrity, model validation)
- Adversarial testing (can AI be fooled?)
- AI/OT integration security (how AI connects to control systems)
- AI incident response (what happens when AI makes wrong decision?)
- AI governance for OT (policies, procedures, oversight)

**The Build Clock connection:**
- Every new plant is being built with more AI than legacy facilities
- Predictive maintenance, autonomous operations, process optimization
- AI security is not optional — it's a gating function for safe operations

### The Play

**"Industrial AI Security Assessment"**
- Evaluate AI models used in OT environments
- Test for adversarial inputs and model poisoning
- Assess AI/OT integration security
- Develop AI governance framework

**Target clients:**
- Semiconductor fabs (AI for process optimization, quality control)
- Battery plants (AI for predictive maintenance, quality)
- Nuclear facilities (AI for fuel optimization, predictive maintenance)
- Grid operators (AI for load forecasting, grid optimization)

**Competitive advantage:** Most AI security vendors focus on **IT/cloud AI**. We focus on **OT AI** — where consequences are physical, not just data.

---

## Niche Opportunity 4: EPC/Vendor OT Security Governance

### The Gap

**Problem:** During construction, **multiple vendors** have access to OT systems:
- EPCs (engineering, procurement, construction)
- System integrators (Rockwell, Siemens, Honeywell)
- Equipment suppliers (ASML, Applied Materials, etc.)
- Commissioning engineers
- Third-party contractors

**Result:** OT security is compromised before the plant even goes live:
- Vendor remote access not properly managed
- Default credentials left in place
- Network segmentation not enforced
- Shadow IT/OT installed by vendors

### The Opportunity

**"Construction-Phase OT Security Governance"**

Manage OT security **during construction**, not after.

**What this includes:**
- Vendor security requirements (contract language, technical specs)
- Vendor access management (who can access what, when, how)
- Network segmentation during construction (temporary zones, vendor networks)
- Security validation at each construction milestone
- Vendor security audits (are they following requirements?)

**The Build Clock connection:**
- Every new plant has 10-20 vendors during construction
- Each vendor is a potential attack vector
- Security gaps introduced during construction are hard to fix later

### The Play

**"EPC/Vendor OT Security Governance"**
- Develop vendor security requirements (template for contracts)
- Manage vendor access during construction
- Validate security at construction milestones
- Transition to operational security at commissioning

**Target clients:**
- Owners building new facilities (semiconductors, batteries, nuclear, grid)
- EPCs (as a service to offer clients)
- Equipment suppliers (as a differentiator)

**Competitive advantage:** Most OT security vendors focus on **operational facilities**. We focus on **construction phase** — where security gaps are introduced.

## Niche Opportunity 5: Build Cycle Intelligence

### The Gap

**Problem:** Deloitte has strong capabilities in:
- Strategy (what should clients do?)
- Implementation (how do we deliver?)
- Operations (how do we run it?)

**But we're missing:** **Market intelligence** that connects policy → pipeline → services.

**The Build Clock reveals:**
- $800B+ in announced investments
- Specific projects, timelines, procurement stages
- Service needs (OT security, supply chain, workforce, etc.)
- **But this intelligence isn't productized or used systematically**

### The Opportunity

**"Build Cycle Intelligence"** — a market intelligence capability that:
- Tracks policy → pipeline → procurement
- Identifies where services are needed, when
- Prioritizes pursuits based on pipeline data
- Creates eminence (we understand the whole system)

**What this includes:**
- Quarterly pipeline updates (what's new, what's changed)
- Sector deep-dives (semiconductors, nuclear, grid, etc.)
- Procurement intelligence (when are decisions happening?)
- Service demand mapping (what capabilities are needed?)

**The Build Clock connection:**
- We built it for ourselves (to understand the market)
- But it's not productized as a client-facing offering
- Could be a differentiator: "We understand the build cycle better than anyone"

### The Play

**"Build Cycle Intelligence Briefings"**
- Quarterly briefings for clients (what's happening in your sector?)
- Pipeline analysis (where should you be investing?)
- Procurement intelligence (what opportunities are coming?)
- Service demand mapping (what capabilities do you need?)

**Target clients:**
- Industrial companies (where should we build? what's the competition?)
- Investors (where is capital flowing? what's the ROI?)
- Government (is policy working? where are the gaps?)

**Competitive advantage:** No one else has this view. Policy analysts don't track implementation. BD teams don't track policy. We connect them.

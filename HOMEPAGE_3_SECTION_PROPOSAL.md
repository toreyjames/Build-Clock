# Homepage 3-Section Proposal
## Hard-Hitting, Action-Driven Structure

**Goal:** Trim homepage to 3 sections that grab attention and drive action.

## Proposed Structure

### **Section 1: THE STAKES** (What's at Risk)
**Headline:** "8% vs 12-15%: The Investment Gap That Gates Everything"

**Content:**
- **The number:** Federal spending is 8% physical investment (need 12-15% for fiscal sustainability)
- **The problem:** Strategic gaps (semiconductors, rare earths, batteries, nuclear fuel, grid)
- **The cost:** China $6-8/hr vs U.S. $30/hr = 3-5x labor disadvantage
- **The consequence:** Can't compete without AI/automation + OT security

**Visual:** 
- Debt clock (simplified)
- Federal spending breakdown (8% vs 12-15% target)
- Strategic gaps comparison (U.S. vs China/competitors)

**CTA:** "See what's missing →" (links to /policy-gaps)

### **Section 2: THE MOMENTUM** (What's Happening Now)
**Headline:** "$800B+ Pipeline: Policy Waves Are Driving Investment"

**Content:**
- **The pipeline:** ${SECTOR_PIPELINE total}B tracked across {projects} projects
- **The policy:** Wave 1 (CHIPS/IRA/IIJA) → Wave 2 (disbursing) → Wave 3 (tariffs)
- **The evidence:** Factory construction 2.5x since CHIPS/IRA ($90B/yr → $225B/yr)
- **The sectors:** Semiconductors, batteries, rare earths, nuclear, grid, AI infrastructure

**Visual:**
- Sector pipeline cards (clickable to /opportunities)
- Policy waves timeline (simplified)
- Factory construction growth chart

**CTA:** "Explore Opportunities →" (links to /opportunities)

### **Section 3: THE GAPS** (Where to Act)
**Headline:** "Prerequisites + OT = The Hidden Infrastructure That Gates Success"

**Content:**
- **The prerequisites:** Rare earth refining, battery processing, HALEU fuel, transmission, equipment lead times
- **The OT requirement:** Every fab/plant/facility needs MES, SCADA, historians, digital twins, OT security
- **The opportunity:** ${OT-relevant pipeline}B in OT-relevant projects
- **The solution:** AI/automation + OT security = path to compete despite labor cost disadvantage

**Visual:**
- Prerequisites grid (6 cards: rare earths, batteries, semiconductors, nuclear, grid, AI imperative)
- OT pipeline callout
- Link to sectors page (AI use cases)

**CTA:** "See Sectors & AI Use Cases →" (links to /sectors)

## What Gets Cut

**Remove:**
- Video section (move to header or separate page)
- Detailed fiscal sustainability target card (keep simple in Section 1)
- GDP impact card (too detailed for homepage)
- Federal spending composition deep-dive (keep simple in Section 1)
- "What's Coming" timeline section (move to /opportunities or separate page)
- Detailed prerequisites breakdown (keep to 6-card grid in Section 3)

**Keep:**
- Header with navigation
- Core metrics (debt, pipeline total, sector breakdown)
- Strategic gaps (simplified)
- Prerequisites grid (simplified)
- Footer with sources

## Design Principles

1. **One number per section** that tells the story
2. **Visual-first** (cards, charts, grids)
3. **Action-oriented CTAs** (not just "learn more")
4. **Progressive disclosure** (details live on sub-pages)
5. **Mobile-friendly** (cards stack, charts responsive)

## Implementation Notes

- Keep existing styles/colors
- Maintain traceable metrics (all sourced)
- Preserve navigation structure
- Add smooth scroll between sections
- Consider sticky header with section navigation
